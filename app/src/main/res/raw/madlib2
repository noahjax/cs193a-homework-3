Hi! This is _person in room_, speaking to you from the broadcasting _noun_ at the _adjective_ forum.
 In case you _verb (past tense)_ in late, the score between the Los Angeles _plural noun_ and the Boston
 _plural noun_ is a squeaker, 141 to _number_. This has been the most _adjective_ game these _adjective_ eyes
 have seen in years. First, one team scores a _noun_, then _exclamation_!--the other team comes right back. Okay, Time-out is
 over. Los Angeles brings in the ball at mid-_noun_. _Another person in room_ dribbles down the _noun_, fakes the
 defender out of his _noun_ and shoots a _number_-handed shot. It goes right through the _noun_. He beat the _noun_! The game is
 over just as the _noun_ goes off.
