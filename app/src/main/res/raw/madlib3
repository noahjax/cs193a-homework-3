It's simple. Turn the _plural noun_. Make him/her want _adverb_ to date you. Make sure you're always dressed to _verb_. Each and every day, wear a/an
 article of clothing_ that shows off your _body part_ to your advantage and makes your _noun_ look like a million _plural noun_. Even if the
 two of you make meaningful _another body part_ contact, don't admit it. No hugs or _plural noun_. Just shake his/her _another body part_ firmly.
 And remember, when he/she asks you out, even though a chill may run down your _noun_ and you can't stop your _noun_ from _verb ending in ing_, just play it
 _adjective_. Take a long pause before answering in a very _adjective_ voice. "I'll have to _verb_ it over."
