Our dining _noun_ used to be a war _noun_. I thought the battles about correct table _plural noun_ would never end. It was us kids versus Mom, and it seemed like a fight that would last to the _adjective_ end.
 But tonight Dad finally declared a/an _adjective_ truce, and we negotiated a/an _adjective_ peace _noun_. Mom promised to no longer get _adverb_ upset and shoot us dirty _plural noun_ and make _adjective_ remarks
 when we do _adjective_ things she doesn't like. We in turn agreed to: Use napkins to wipe our _part of the body (plural)_ and not our _plural noun_, Keep our _part of the body (plural)_ off the table, and never talk
 with food in our _part of the body (plural)_.
